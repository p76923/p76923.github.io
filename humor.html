<h1>Humor</h1>

The punchline is left as an exercise for the reader.

<h2>The Earth is flat</h2>

Theorem: The Earth is flat.<br>

Proof: The Earth is locally flat. However, flatness is a local property. Thus, the Earth is flat.

<h2>On the non-existence of bananas</h2>

<p>Theorem: Bananas do not exist.<br>

Proof: A banana, if it exists, must be a polynomial--it has finitely many roots in a field, and splits.
However, bananas do not split over fields, but in kitchens, because fields are too hot and would cause the ice cream to melt.
Thus, bananas cannot be polynomials, and so cannot exist.</p>

<p>Alternative proof: Consider the set of banana splitting field jokes. By commutativity of a field, this is equivalent to the set field of banana splitting jokes.
However, the set of banana splitting jokes is not a field. For instance, when you add two jokes to each other, the result is often unfunny and thus not a joke.</p>

<h2>Galois and vector spaces</h2>

<p>What is the difference between &Eacute;variste Galois and a vector space?<br>

A vector space has a second dual.</br>

<h2>Closed safe</h2>

<p>Two thieves try to break into a metal safe in the shape of a cube.</p>

<p>The first thief picks at it and pulls at it and tries everything, but the door does not budge a bit.<br>
"Ugh. It's strongly closed," he mutters before giving up.</p>

<p>The second thief simply smiles, walks up to the safe, and gently pulls the door open.<br>
His companion looks at him in awe and asks, "How did you do that?"<br>
To which he responds, "Since the safe was strongly closed and convex, it was also weakly closed."</p>

<h2>Principals and teaching</h2>

<p>High school principals often do not teach; the reason cited is that the administrative work is onerous enough.<br>
However, principals should teach. In fact, they should teach the first class in the morning.<br>This is because class number one is a principal ideal domain.</p>
