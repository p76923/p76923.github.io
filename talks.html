<h1>Selected Talks</h1>

"Talkin' talk is not just talk, being there is half the walk." -- D'Sound, "Talkin' Talk"

<h2>Unit Fraction Decompositions in \( \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \mathbb{F}_q(t) \) (UGA Math Club, 2024) </h2> (joint work with R. Agrawal, N. McNew, and P. Pollack)

(Notes to come)

<h2>Ehrhart theory (UGA Graduate Student Seminar, Fall 2023)</h2>

Integer polytopes show up in many areas of mathematics, such as combinatorics, coding theory, linear programming, and number theory. Ehrhart theory is at heart the study of counting lattice points in integer polytopes. As it turns out, these counts often encode fundamental properties of these polytopes. In this talk, we will give a basic overview of the field, its connections to other areas of mathematics, and discuss some results and open questions.

<h2>Almost Ready for Prime Time: Elementary Results Towards the Prime Number Theorem (Ross Mathematics Program, Summer 2023)</h2>

The celebrated prime number theorem states that \( \pi(x) \), the function that counts the number of primes in the interval \([1, x]\), is asymptotically \(x/\log(x)\) as \(x\) goes to infinity. The original proofs of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin utilized complex analysis and are quite difficult; even "elementary" proofs like those of Erdős and Selberg are quite technical. However, the weaker result that \(\pi(x)\) is bounded above and below by two positive multiples of \(x/\log(x) \), i.e., \( c_1 x/\log(x) \le \pi(x) \le c_2 x/\log(x) \) for some \(0 < c_1 < c_2 \), attributed to Chebyshev, is much more accessible; it can be proved only requiring basic calculus at most. We will survey a proof of Chebyshev's theorem and related results, such as Bertrand's postulate, which states that for all \( n > 1 \) the interval \( (n, 2n) \) contains at least one prime.

<h2>The worst way to find the area of a circle (UGA Graduate Student Seminar, Spring 2022)</h2>

Counting the number of integer lattice points inside a circle of a given radius \(r\) gives a good estimate of its area, especially when \(r\) is large. Gauss' circle problem asks just how good this estimate is, i.e., for a precise estimate of the error. In today's talk, we give an overview of analytic methods, particularly from the theory of automorphic forms, used to tackle this problem and related problems.
