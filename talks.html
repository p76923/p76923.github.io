<h1>Selected Talks</h1>

"Talkin' talk is not just talk, being there is half the walk." -- D'Sound, "Talkin' Talk"

<h2>Unit Fraction Decompositions in \( \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \mathbb{F}_q(t) \) </h2> (joint with Rishika Agrawal, Nathan McNew, and Paul Pollack)

<h2>Ehrhart theory (UGA Graduate Student Seminar, Fall 2023)</h2>

Integer polytopes show up in many areas of mathematics, such as combinatorics, coding theory, linear programming, and number theory. Ehrhart theory is at heart the study of counting lattice points in integer polytopes. As it turns out, these counts often encode fundamental properties of these polytopes. In this talk, we will give a basic overview of the field, its connections to other areas of mathematics, and discuss some results and open questions.

<h2>The worst way to find the area of a circle (UGA Graduate Student Seminar, Spring 2022)</h2>

Counting the number of integer lattice points inside a circle of a given radius \(r\) gives a good estimate of its area, especially when \(r\) is large. Gauss' circle problem asks just how good this estimate is, i.e., for a precise estimate of the error. In today's talk, we give an overview of analytic methods, particularly from the theory of automorphic forms, used to tackle this problem and related problems.
